            <li>2-3 bay leaves</li>
            <li>2-3 whole green cardamom pods</li>
            <li>1-inch cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>3-4 cloves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust according to taste)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon saffron strands soaked in 1/4 cup warm milk</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Water as needed</li>
        </ol></p>
        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash the basmati rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>Marinate the chicken pieces with yogurt, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Heat ghee or oil in a heavy-bottomed pan or pressure cooker. Add the whole spices (bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, cumin seeds) and saut√© until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add the sliced onions and cook until they turn golden brown.</li>
                <li>Stir in the minced garlic, grated ginger, and green chilies. Cook for a few minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and the oil starts to separate.</li>
                <li>Now, add the marinated chicken pieces and cook on high heat until they are seared and browned on all sides.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the chicken cook in its juices for about 20-25 minutes. If using a pressure cooker, cook for about 2-3 whistles.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt and the soaked basmati rice. Cook the rice until it is 70% done, then drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>Once the chicken is tender and cooked through, adjust the seasoning and consistency of the curry. Add water if needed to achieve the desired thickness.</li>
                <li>In a separate large pot, layer the chicken curry, cooked rice, fried onions, fresh coriander leaves, fresh mint leaves, garam masala, and saffron milk. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used up.</li>
                <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes until the rice is fully cooked and aromatic.</li>
                <li>Fluff the biryani gently with a fork, ensuring the layers remain intact. Serve hot with raita, salad, or your favorite side dish.</li>
            </ol>
