            <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mustard oil (or any cooking oil)</li>
            <li>2-3 bay leaves</li>
            <li>2-3 whole green cardamom pods</li>
            <li>1-inch cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>3-4 cloves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust according to taste)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh coriander leaves for garnish</li>
            <li>Water as needed</li>
            </ul>
        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the mutton pieces with yogurt, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pan or pressure cooker. Add the whole spices (bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, cumin seeds) and saut√© until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onions and cook until they turn golden brown.</li>
            <li>Stir in the minced garlic, grated ginger, and green chilies. Cook for a few minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and the oil starts to separate.</li>
            <li>Now, add the marinated mutton pieces and cook on high heat until they are seared and browned on all sides.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the mutton cook in its juices for about 45 minutes to 1 hour. If using a pressure cooker, cook for about 4-5 whistles.</li>
            <li>Once the mutton is tender and cooked through, adjust the seasoning and consistency of the curry. Add water if needed to achieve the desired thickness.</li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve hot with steamed rice or naan bread.</li>
        </ol>
